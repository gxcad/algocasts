// Encrypt this!

// You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

//     Your message is a string containing space separated words.
//     You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
//         The first letter needs to be converted to its ASCII code.
//         The second letter needs to be switched with the last letter
//     Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in input.

// Examples:

const encryptThis = function(text) {
  
}

console.log(encryptThis("Hello")); // === "72olle"
console.log(encryptThis("good")); // === "103doo"
console.log(encryptThis("hello world")); // === "104olle 119drlo"
